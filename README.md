## General Information

Lending Club is a platform that connects borrowers seeking personal loans with investors looking to lend money in exchange for a return. When the company receives a loan application, it must decide whether to approve the loan based on the applicantâ€™s profile. 

The objective of this case study is to identify applicants who are at high risk of defaulting on their loans, so the company can reduce its exposure to credit loss. The approach involves using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze a dataset of 39k applicants, which includes pre- and post-loan data across 100+ features. 

By analyzing these variables, the aim is to uncover patterns that can help predict which applicants pose the highest risk.
